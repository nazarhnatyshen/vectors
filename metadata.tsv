Came in at a grand and some change.Many others here started getting orders cancelled with little communication for what seems like double tablet trade in or the PayPal code I had to kick the delivery date out till 8th August due to a holiday.My payment in PayPal and the attached card remained at pending for some time until early yesterday.So now.....Order with Samsung now shows as confirmed, so it's moved on from Acknowledged.PayPal transaction shows as complete. My Halifax CC app (the only card attached to PP) has dropped the pending transaction and had no knowledge of any Samsung transaction.So Samsung thinks it's paid, PayPal thinks it's paid, Halifax knows nothing. Any thoughts?

In 1976, it became the first of his works to be adapted for the big screen and, to this day, remains one of the very best. Carrie marked Brian De Palma's arrival as a major director, following smaller cult films such as Sisters, Phantom of the Paradise and Obsession, and provided a key early role for Sissy Spacek (Badlands), one that would earn her a Best Actress nomination at the Academy Awards. Piper Laurie would also pick up a nomination as Carrie's mother, while future stars such as Amy Irving, John Travolta and Nancy Allen were given their first major parts in a big-screen production.Special Features: Bonus Footage, Commentary: Lee Gambin and Alexandra Heller-Nicholas (authors), Documentaries: 'Acting Carrie'; 'More Acting Carrie'; 'Visualising Carrie: From Words to Images'; 'Singing Carrie: Carrie the Musical'; 'Horror's Hallowed Grounds'; 'Comparing Carrie', Image Gallery, Interviews: Lawrence D.

Craft made and deeply luxurious Marc de Champagne Truffles in a beautiful gift box. Soft, nutty, single estate dark chocolate gently entwines with smooth Marc de Champagne and freshly roasted hazelnuts. 100% Natural. Vegan. Soya Free. Gluten Free. Palm Oil Free Artisan chocolate, made bean to bar for the purest flavours. We use the world’s great single estate cacaos which are like fine wines, each with its own unique flavour. To preserve these precious flavours, we make our chocolate in small batches, at low temperatures, taking up to 21 days (industrial chocolate takes a few hours). We make everything ourselves, not just the chocolate. So for these truffles, we roast the hazelnuts to capture their flavour at its freshly roasted peak and press the cocoa powder on our beautiful old Spanish cocoa butter press. Ethically sourced - Direct Trade. Being a cocoa farmer himself, Willie puts the farmers at the heart of how he does business, buying all his cacao Direct Trade, paying a higher price premium than Fair Trade. Willie Harcourt-Cooze, cacao farmer, pioneer and chocolate fanatic, has redefined how millions of people worldwide think about chocolate. He started out buying a cocoa farm in Venezuela 20 years ago, and set up the UK’s first artisan ‘bean to bar’ chocolate factory in 2008.

From the opening shot--a sign reading 'Stop'--to the final message of 'Increase the Peace', Singleton's desire to galvanise his audience is clear. The violence destroying South Central Los Angeles is seen through the eyes of Tre Styles (Cuba Gooding Jr.), whose intelligence and common sense would be wasted in the 'hood if not for his father, Furious (Laurence Fishburne), who imparts discipline and responsibility to his son. Tre's friends aren't so lucky, though, especially Doughboy (Ice Cube), who has been in and out of institutions since childhood and now sits on his porch with a forty in his hand and a pistol in his waistband. Singleton is ambitious enough to tackle a host of problems, from African American business practices to the bias of the SAT test, but the real power of the film lies in the performances of its principals. Cuba Gooding, in his first role, doesn't let Tre come off like a goody two-shoes, while Ice Cube gives a tragic nobility to a young man who knows he's doomed.Product specifications:The Boyz N the Hood Blu-ray (2020) is a home media release of the classic film.product specifications:Leading Actor: Morris ChestnutDirector: SingletonCertification: 15Number of discs: 2Region: BDuration: 112 minsFormat: Blu-ray / 4K Ultra HD
